# Hybrid Server Client Rendered Website - WITHOUT Scroll Restoration

This directory demonstrates a hybrid website using a mix of typical HTML file based pages and JavaScript to dynamically load content.

Scroll restoration isn't being manually implemented, so we also see that the browser can't automatically restore scroll position.

## Getting Started

There is no packaged server or build tools with this solution. Please use local web server to run.
